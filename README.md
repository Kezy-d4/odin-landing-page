# odin-landing-page

# Preface
  The aim of this project is to utilize CSS Flexbox to recreate the design specification provided for a generic landing page. To begin, I will only attempt to match the design specification given and meet the project requirements, not experimenting with any of my own unique design or content at this time. This project should specifically allow for good practice and demonstration of the CSS and Flexbox skills I have been learning in the Odin curriculum. As usual, this project will also allow for practice with HTML, Git/Github, VSCode, and the command line.

# Postface
  The project is complete and I'm fairly happy with it. It felt like a wrestling match with Flexbox at times, but it was solid practice. I've gained a better understanding of div nesting and the relationship between flex parents and children. I may revisit the project someday and attempt to make adjustments to the existing code and/or add my own design and content.
