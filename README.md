# odin-landing-page

Preface:
  The aim of this project is to utilize CSS Flexbox to recreate the design specification provided for a generic landing page. To begin, I will only attempt to match the design specification given and meet the project requirements, not experimenting with any of my own unique design or content at this time. This project should specifically allow for good practice and demonstration of the CSS and Flexbox skills I have been learning in the Odin curriculum. It will also allow for practice with HTML, Git/Github, and the command line, as usual.
